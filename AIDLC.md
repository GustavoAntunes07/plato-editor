# Plato Editor AI-DLC

AI-assisted Development Lifecycle for repositories that use coding agents.

# Project

## Project Setup Check

A project is considered configured when:

- Project name is defined
- Project description is defined
- Tech stack is defined
- Main commands are defined
- Default branches are defined
- `.aidlc/config.yaml` exists and is valid
- Required Codex agents exist in `.codex/agents/`
- No template placeholders remain

## Description

Plato Editor is a local-first Markdown knowledge editor inspired by tools like Obsidian. The MVP is a desktop app that lets users create, edit, organize, and search notes inside a local vault while keeping the user's files portable and readable outside the app.

The project uses AI-DLC as its repository workflow contract for Codex-style coding agents. Agent work stays tied to explicit intents, planning is separated from implementation and review, and the CLI validates setup, intent structure, governance rules, and lifecycle transitions.

Primary product users are people who want a private, local-first writing and knowledge management environment. Primary repository users are developers who want AI agents to work inside a repeatable process instead of ad hoc chat sessions.

## Tech Stack

- Bun
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- Tauri 2
- Rust
- SQLite
- Markdown
- TOML agent configuration
- YAML lifecycle configuration

## Main Commands

### Install

```bash
bun install
```

### Check Setup

```bash
bun aidlc:check
```

### Local Quality Check

```bash
bun run check
```

### Lint

```bash
bun run lint
```

### Install Git Hooks

```bash
bun run hooks:install
```

### Create Intent

```bash
bun aidlc:new "Add login page"
```

New intents use short base36 IDs, such as `INTENT-k9f2`, while older intent IDs remain valid.

### Status

```bash
bun aidlc:status
```

### Verify Intent Branch

```bash
bun aidlc:branch INTENT-001
```

### Close Intent

```bash
bun aidlc close INTENT-k9f2 duplicate
```

Use `closed` for intents that should remain in project history but should not continue through implementation.

### Doctor

```bash
bun aidlc:doctor
```

Application commands will be added after the desktop app is scaffolded.

# Core Rules

These rules override any agent-specific behavior.

- Always work from an intent file.
- Never commit without explicit developer approval.
- Never push without explicit developer approval.
- Update the intent after each completed stage.
- Use the CLI state machine for status transitions.
- Verify the intent branch before moving to `in_development`.
- Run project validation before marking an intent as approved or done.
- Run local quality checks before moving implementation work to review.
- Never modify unrelated code.
- Never change architecture without notifying the developer.
- Every implementation intent should have its own development branch unless the developer explicitly chooses otherwise.

Branch naming convention:

```txt
intent/<intent-id>-<short-description>
```

Example:

```txt
intent/k9f2-add-login-page
```

Unless explicitly requested by the developer, implementation should not occur directly in the default development branch.

---

# Out-Of-Lifecycle Work

Users may ask questions outside the development lifecycle. These interactions do not need an intent when they are read-only and do not change repository state.

No intent is required for:

- Questions
- Explanations
- Brainstorming
- Read-only exploration
- Meta discussion about AI-DLC itself

An intent is required for:

- File edits
- Code changes
- Tests
- Review
- Documentation updates
- Lifecycle transitions
- Persistent repo/process changes

If a read-only discussion turns into implementation work, create or select an intent before editing files.

---

# Source of Truth

- Global project rules: `AIDLC.md`
- Runtime lifecycle configuration: `.aidlc/config.yaml`
- Agent behavior: `.codex/agents/` and `skills/`
- Unit of work: `intents/INTENT-*.md`
- Architecture docs: `docs/`

When documentation and `.aidlc/config.yaml` disagree, the config controls CLI behavior and the documentation should be updated.

---

# Governance Profiles

Governance profiles define how often the workflow must stop for developer approval. The active profile is configured in `.aidlc/config.yaml`.

## strict

Stops after every lifecycle stage. Use this for high-risk work, architecture changes, security-sensitive changes, or when onboarding a new workflow.

## standard

Requires approval before implementation starts and before final completion. Use this for normal feature work where planning and final sign-off matter most.

## autonomous

Allows the agent to continue until validation fails, review rejects the work, or a risk/blocker needs developer input. Use this for low-risk, well-scoped maintenance tasks.

---

# Human Approval Gates

The current governance profile determines where the workflow pauses. When a configured gate is reached, the agent should ask the developer whether to:

- Continue to the next stage
- Repeat the current stage
- Stop the workflow
- Modify the intent
- Change the implementation approach

Example:

```txt
Builder completed INTENT-005.

The implementation is ready for testing.

The strict governance profile requires approval at ready_for_testing.

Would you like me to:
1. Continue to Tester
2. Review the implementation together
3. Rework the implementation
4. Stop here
```

---

# Intent Lifecycle

The lifecycle is enforced by `.aidlc/config.yaml` and the CLI transition command.

```txt
backlog
    |
    v
context_ready
    |
    v
in_development
    |
    v
ready_for_testing
    |
    v
review
    |
    v
approved
    |
    v
done
```

Any active intent may also be closed when it is abandoned, duplicated, superseded, stale, or invalid:

```txt
backlog/context_ready/in_development/ready_for_testing/review/approved/escalated
    |
    v
closed
```

Rejected intents return to:

```txt
in_development
```

Escalated intents return to:

```txt
backlog
```

after being rewritten.

Before moving an intent to `in_development`, verify the current branch:

```bash
bun aidlc:branch INTENT-001
```

When branch enforcement is enabled, `context_ready -> in_development` fails if the current Git branch does not match the intent's `branch:` field.

Use:

```bash
bun aidlc transition INTENT-001 context_ready
```

or:

```bash
bun scripts/aidlc.ts transition INTENT-001 context_ready
```

To close an intent without satisfying the Definition of Done, use:

```bash
bun scripts/aidlc.ts close INTENT-k9f2 duplicate
```

---

# Definition of Ready

An intent may only move from `backlog` to `context_ready` when:

- Description exists
- Acceptance criteria exist
- Scope is reasonably clear
- Required project context is available
- Related files are recorded when applicable

---

# Definition of Done

An intent may only be marked as `done` when:

- Acceptance criteria are satisfied
- Acceptance criteria are checked in the intent
- Tests or validation commands pass
- Test Notes record the validation result
- Reviewer approved the implementation
- Review Notes record the approval
- Documentation was updated if necessary
- Developer explicitly approved completion

---

# Definition of Closed

An intent may be marked as `closed` when the work should not continue but should remain visible in repository history.

Common close reasons:

- `stale`
- `duplicate`
- `abandoned`
- `superseded`
- `invalid`

Closed intents are terminal records. They do not need to satisfy the Definition of Done, and they should not be selected by `aidlc next`.

# Pipeline Configuration

Pipeline behavior belongs in:

```txt
.aidlc/config.yaml
```

The config defines:

- Active governance profile
- Branch naming
- Branch enforcement
- Maximum review cycles
- Validation commands
- Required agents
- Approval gates
- Lifecycle transitions

Local quality checks are documented in `docs/local-quality-checks.md`.

---

# Codex Model And Reasoning Verification

Codex model defaults belong in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Trusted repositories can also provide project-scoped overrides in `.codex/config.toml`.

Common settings:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
```

Configuration precedence, highest first:

- CLI flags and `--config` overrides
- Trusted project `.codex/config.toml`
- Selected profile config
- User `~/.codex/config.toml`
- System config
- Built-in defaults

To verify intended configuration:

```bash
codex --model gpt-5.5
codex --config model_reasoning_effort='"high"'
```

For runtime evidence, enable Codex logs or OpenTelemetry. Conversation start events include model and reasoning settings, which are stronger evidence than reading config files alone.

---

# Intent Schema

Each intent is stored inside:

```txt
intents/
```

Example:

```md
---
id: INTENT-k9f2
title: Add login page
status: backlog
story_points: 3
retry_count: 0
branch: intent/k9f2-add-login-page
---

# Description

Add user authentication with email and password.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can log in
- [ ] User can log out
- [ ] Errors are handled correctly

# Related Files

# Implementation Notes

# Test Notes

# Review Notes

# Commits
```

# Agent Configuration

Agent-specific behavior belongs in:

```txt
.codex/agents/
```

Expected agent files:

```txt
aidlc-orchestrator.toml
reader.toml
planner.toml
builder.toml
tester.toml
reviewer.toml
documenter.toml
```

Agent files define responsibilities. Workflow rules belong in `AIDLC.md` and executable workflow configuration belongs in `.aidlc/config.yaml`.
